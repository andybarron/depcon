error[E0478]: lifetime bound not satisfied
 --> tests/derive_injectable/fail/non_static.rs:4:10
  |
4 | #[derive(Injectable)]
  |          ^^^^^^^^^^
  |
note: lifetime parameter instantiated with the lifetime `'a` as defined here
 --> tests/derive_injectable/fail/non_static.rs:5:18
  |
5 | struct NonStatic<'a>(PhantomData<&'a ()>);
  |                  ^^
  = note: but lifetime parameter must outlive the static lifetime
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Injectable` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
